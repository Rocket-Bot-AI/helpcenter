# Interactive Brokers

Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is a very popular all around established broker. It has access to a wide range of markets, and offers competitive fees.
While RocketBot was not built to trade on IBKR, it is still possible to use it via Collective 2.


## Create an Interactive Brokers Account
IBKR supports multiple type of accounts. Assuming you have no account created and would like to create a new one, we recommend you create an "Individual Investor or Trader" account as shown in the figure below.

### 3. Configure Trading account

You will now be asked questions that are meant to determine your level of experience with trading in general.
Be as honest as you can, however, be advised that if your liquid net worth is less than 50,000$ IBKR will not allow you to trade futures, which are the products traded by Rocket Bot.
