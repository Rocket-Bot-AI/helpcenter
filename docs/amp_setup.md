# Setting up Rocket Bot on AMP Futures
AMP futures is a popular futures brokers.
The reason we chose it is because they support Metatrader5.
While other trading software can be really powerful for daytraders (ninjetrader, quantower, etc...) they are however very complex (if not impossible) to use in a pure algorithmic way.
That is primarly because most work on windows only.
Metatrader also needs windows, however wine support is robust and mature.


## Creating an AMP futures account.
Before getting started, it is important to note that AMP has 2 branches:
+ AMP futures is based in the US and allows only futures trading
+ AMP Global is based in the EU, allows for futures and CFD's
The reason why we choose AMP futures is because of their flexible fee structure, both in commissions and withdrawal fees.
