# Collective 2  Setup

##  What and why Collective 2
[Collective 2](https://collective2.com/) is a platform that allows you to follow and automatically copy the trades of other traders. 
We are using it because it simplifies a lot of the hurdles we might face when offering our trading robots.
Here's key facts to know:

1. With collective 2, you do NOT have to give us your money. It stays safely in your brokerage account.
2. Collective 2 charges a fee in order to connect to your brokerage account and mirror the trades from rocket bot
3. We charge a flat monthly fee in order to manage your strategy. 
   
Traditional hedge fund charge a 2% management fee regardless of performance, and then take around 20% of the profits they generate to you.
With Collective 2, you don't get charged the 20% performance fee, and the management fee is not a function of capital but a flat monthly fee!
